# Product analysis: 
we can analyze the product data to identify which
categories are most popular, which products have the highest and lowest
ratings, which products have the highest and lowest prices, and which
products are most frequently purchased.

themes and issues mentioned by customers, identify which products have

in leaving reviews.
